# ML-Driven Clinical Prediction System with RESTful APIs

A Machine Learning–powered web application that predicts **newborn birth weight** based on maternal and pregnancy-related factors.  
The application is built using **Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn** and deployed live using **Render**.

## 📌 Project Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

- Understand clinical data-based regression problems
- Perform data preprocessing and feature selection
- Train a regression model using Scikit-learn
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Serialize and load models using Pickle
- Build RESTful APIs using Flask
- Deploy ML models as real-world web services
