# 🧠 Birth Weight Prediction – ML-Driven Clinical Prediction System

This project implements a **Machine Learning–based regression model** using Python to predict **newborn birth weight** based on maternal and pregnancy-related clinical features.  
The trained model is deployed using **Flask REST APIs** and can be accessed via both **HTTP requests and a simple web interface**.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

The main goals of this project are:

- Understand clinical data-based regression problems
- Perform data preprocessing and feature selection
- Train a regression model using Scikit-learn
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
- Serialize and load models using Pickle
- Build RESTful APIs using Flask
- Deploy ML models as real-world web services
